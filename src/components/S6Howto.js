          PSL and English Premiership matches form the core of Soccer 6 pools, but games from the French, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish leagues are
          utilised, as well as international clashes and matches from UEFA Champions League etc. We strive to offer entertaining and challenging pools that
          contain the best matches sourced from a variety of leagues and competitions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the teams involved in Soccer 6 pools is published on this site and includes one or more of league table and head-to-head form guides
          and comments, previews and tips from our team of experts.
        </p>

        <strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> In Soccer 6 and other TAB soccer bets, the result of a match is the score at the end of the normal 90-minute playing
        period plus any injury time that may be played. Extra time and penalty shootouts are of no account.
      </p>
      <h2>Soccer 6 is easy to play!</h2>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          There are six games in a Soccer 6 pool â€“ M1 through M6. To win, you must predict the results of the six matches. In each game, one team is designated
          Team A and the other Team B.
        </p>
        <p>There are 3 results to choose from in each match:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Team A to Win</li>
          <li>Draw</li>
          <li>Team B to Win</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>The computerised tote betting system uses numbers to denote the above options:</p>
      <p>
        1 = Win by Team A; 2 = Draw; 3 = Win by Team B. So when you bet by phone or use a betting form, use the numbers 1, 2 and 3 to denote your choices. The
        same numbers are used to display results, while M1 is used to denote Match 1, M2 for Match 2 and so on.
      </p>
      <p>With Soccer 6, you can play a single or multiple entry. With a single entry, you select ONE option or choice for each match and the bet costs R6.</p>
      <p>
        With a multiple entry, you can choose more than one option in one or more matches. The cost is R6 per combination. To calculate the number of
        combinations, multiply out the total number of options or choices for each match. Then take that total and multiply it by 6 to calculate the cost of the
        bet.
      </p>
      <h2>When To Play?</h2>
      <p>
        There are Soccer 6 pools every day. For Saturday or Saturday-Sunday pools, bets can usually be played from Friday until the start of the earliest Soccer

      <p>
