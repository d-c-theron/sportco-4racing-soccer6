      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6.11.1.3.3 </strong>A special draw to determine the result of a match will take place if: a match commences before the start of the pool; a
        match is not concluded by the end of the pool; interrupted match. The result will be drawn from a pool of 16 lots and is a process done by a computer

        <strong>CALCULATION OF DIVIDEND: </strong>
        In the event there is one winning ticket (13 out of 13 correct) the payout will be from a Guaranteed Fund of R10, 000, 000 (Ten Million Rand) subject to
        change due to exchange rate fluctuation. Other than in that instance, the Net pool is split into winning groups as follows: 13 out of 13 correct – 40%

      <p>
        <strong>6.11.1.4.1 </strong>
        If a winning line is not found in any group other than the first winnings group, that winnings group will be discarded and its winnings total divided
        equally between the remaining winnings groups in the pool.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6.11.1.4.2 </strong>
        The winnings per line in lower winnings groups must not exceed the winnings per line in higher winnings groups. Surplus sums will be divided equally

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6.11.1.4.3 </strong>

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6.11.1.4.4 </strong>
        The Operator reserves the right to delay dividend payments until such time as net money room settlement has been affected between the Host tote and the

        If a game that has not started, is abandoned or postponed and the game is due to be rescheduled for play within 2 days from the initial scheduling of
        the game the bet is kept open for the game to take place and then the actual result is used before a dividend is declared. If a game is permanently
        abandoned or postponed until a day beyond the 2 day cut off, then a result is determined by the drawing of lots process (refer to 6.12.3.3 above).

      <p>
        <strong>6.14.8.1 </strong>1 – If no all 5 correct winner/s, Pool A is carried forward to Pool A of next Time Bomb pool or a Time Bomb pool nominated by

      <p>
        <strong>6.14.8.2 </strong>2 – If no any 4 correct winner/s, Pool B is added to Pool C* and total of both pools goes to any 3 correct winner/s.

        correct winners, then the totals of Pools B and C will be divided among all any 1 correct winner/s.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>6.14.8.4 </strong>* Consequently at least 55% of every Time Bomb pool should be paid out. In the event that no entry has even one match correct,

      <p>
        In such pools 95% will be paid out – if no all 5 correct winner/s, Pool A added to Pool B and total paid to any 4 correct; if no all 5 correct nor any 4
        correct winner/s, then total of Pools A, B and C paid to any 3 correct, or any 2 or 1 if necessary.

        Any match in a Time Bomb pool not completed by 9am on the day after the last day on which matches in the pool were scheduled, shall be deemed abandoned
        and all choices shall qualify. In such an event the A portion of the pool shall automatically be carried over and all entries shall qualify only for
        payouts emanating from the B and C portions of the pool. The times at which matches are completed will be as supplied by the operator's official source,
        notwithstanding the operator's decision in terms of when a match has not been completed shall be final and binding. The Operator reserves the right to
